BILL OF MATERIALS

--AUTOSTART--
- 1x Arduino nano or similar
- 1x servo motor, 0-180Â°, preferrably one with metallic gears, as vibration will kill the cheapos. Might kill the metallic one too.
- Mushroom latching normally closed Emergency stop. MUST BE CONNECTED IN A WAY THAT IT KILLS THE GENERATOR IF PUSHED.
- 3 Arduino 5V Relays
  - Connect 
- 0-2 LED in different colors, if any combination of LED indication is wanted
- Normally Closed MANUAL/AUTO switch could come in handy (has for me anyway).

--TRANSFER BOX--
- 2x contactors with at least 1x NO and 1x NC contact set (preferrably 2 sets each contactor)

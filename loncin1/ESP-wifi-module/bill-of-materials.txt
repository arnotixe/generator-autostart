BILL OF MATERIALS

--Wi-Fi module--
- 1x ESP32WROOM or similar
- 0-2 Arduino 5V Relay, if you want to control the generator in one or both ways
- 0-3 LED in different colors, if any combination of LED indication is wanted
- Normally Open external reset switch could come in handy (has for me anyway).

--TRANSFER BOX--
- 115V monitoring relay to detect whether the generator is supplying power or not
- ["mains ok" could be taken from the Mains contactor helper contacts, or add another relay for Mains monitoring]
- ["generator connected" could be taken from the Generator contactor helper contacts, or add another relay for monitoring]
